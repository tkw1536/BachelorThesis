\section{Introduction}

\ednote{Write an introductary sentence / paragraph?}

MathWebSearch (MWS for short\ednote{should I really use abbreviations here?}) is a system to search (latex) documents for mathematical formulae. Additionally it can also search for text in the documents\ednote{Or is this the multi-faceted search that is currently planned? Do we really need this sentence?}. However it not only searches for formulae in a simple-minded string way but also includes simple transformation rules, such as $a + b = b + a$. Additionally, is is possible to search with wildcards such as $ { \color{red} x} + \sqrt{\color{red} x}$. In this example MWS delivers results of the given form where $\color{red} x$ is substituted with any sub-formular\ednote{Re-formulate this and link to an example}.

MWS has been shown to be very useful for mathematicians\ednote{Quote neeeded}. The transformation system it uses can currently be used only for mathematical formulae which limits its applications. In this paper we propose an extension for physical units\ednote{Reformulate this?}. Instead of transforming mathematical formulae, the search engine should transfer physical units.
The end-user will search, for example, \SI{100}{\degreeCelsius} and also get results which show $212$$^\circ$F or $373.15$K.

This proposal is organised as follows\ednote{Update this possible if we change the structure}: In section \ref{sec:mws} we shortly describe and discuss the existing MathWebSearch system and then proceed in section \ref{sec:extension} to describe in detail the proposed extension. Finally in section \ref{sec:problems_relatedwork} we discuss possible problems with this approach and related work.

\section{Background - The existing MathWebSearch system}
\label{sec:mws}

As mentioned above, MathWebSearch is a search engine for mathmatical formulars in documents. It has a corpus of ??? \ednote{Get an estimate here} documents and is currently deployed and used by ??? and ??? \ednote{where? }.

The frontend, running client-side in a web browser, is written in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. It accesses a REST backend and dependens on MathML support to render Mathematics. It simply accessing a REST backend via AJAX. When the client enters a LaTeX forumar to search for, the backend renders MathML which is then sent back to the client. Next, the client renders the MathML (to show the formular the user is searching for) and also sends back the MathML to the server to search for it. Finally the server sends back results to the client which then shows a list of them.

The backend, written in ?? \ednote{What is the backend written in?}, as can be seen from the procedure during a common search, has 2 independent components. The LaTeX to MathML rendering is not part of MathWebSearch but rather uses LaTeXML \ednote{Really? Reference needed. }. The searching is handled by MWS directly.

For each corpus a big search index is generated before search \ednote{Explain this better}. Then during runtime only this index is searched. \ednote{Explain theory graphs here}

\ednote{Explain how MWS uses those here}

Advantages of this approach / how MWS is received
\ednote{Find points here}

Disadvantages of the current approach
\begin{itemize}
  \item has to be re-generated each time a document is added
\end{itemize}

\section{The proposed extension}
\label{sec:extension}

\begin{itemize}
  \item want a complete system
  \item searches a corpus of documents for units
  \item which is presentable to the end user
  \item should be extendable with respect to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the corpus. Plugging in a new corpus should be as easy as running a script somehwere.
    \item the units. Adding new units should be simple by just adding a conversion to one already known unit.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The frontend
\begin{itemize}
  \item a web page
  \item should work in modern browsers, preferably mobile-friendly
  \item should only be a frontend for a REST backend
  \item has an input for a unit
  \item has an input for a value
  \item maybe have facetet search on top
\end{itemize}

The backend
\begin{itemize}
  \item REST based
  \item based on the existing system
  \item has to have a format of units
  \item has to receive text queries
  \item has to receive exact values or ranges or automatically generated ranges
\end{itemize}

The corpus
\begin{itemize}
  \item should consist of a lot of tex documents
  \item should have marked up units
  \item ideally, if a single document is added, only the new corpus should have to be re-scanned (procedular generation)
  \item should be easily exchangable
\end{itemize}

The unit transition system
\begin{itemize}
  \item should be a graph
  \item should have few connected components and each of the components should be sparse (i. e. few connections)
  \item translation are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item either a factor towards a single unit
    \item or a composition of a factor together with a product or fraction of units \ednote{Figure out more details about this}
    \item Perhaps include prefixes somehow?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\ednote{Write this}

\section{Problems and related Work}
\label{sec:problems_relatedwork}

There are several problems with this approach. \ednote{Continue intro pargraph}

The units have to be entered in some fashion in the search engine. While it is trivial to design an interface where a single unit can be entered, it is non-trivial when we want to recognise composite units as well. Furthermore si-prefixes (such as kilo or mini) should also be recognised which is an additional problem. There are a few alternatives to use as input formats: AsciiMath, LaTeX and MathML, to name only 3. Independent of the input format, the end result (delivered to the backend of the search engine) should be MathML containing the unit in some yet-to-be-determined standard form.

As described above, the unit equivalences should be in the form of a theory graph \ednote{Reference this properly. } The equivalence
(translation) itself contains both a translation for the quantity and the unit. The values searched for should be simple real numbers together with the forumlar. However since all numbers must be represented in a finite fashion, translations formulars can gvie problems. A natural quantity in one unit can be a repeating decimal in a another unit. Also rounding of quantities might depend on the unit used. It is thus preferable not not search for an exact value but instead for a range of values. These ranges should depend on the unit. These ranges have just been implemented in MWS by Radu \ednote{Quote needed; reformulate}. \ednote{Write excatly how to use ranges}

Finally, there are the problems of finding a corpus and marking up units in this corpus. The second problem, marking up units in a corpus, will be taken on by ???\ednote{Who is doing unit finding?} in a seperate thesis. The first problem will be postponed for now. In case there is still time, a suitably corpus can be marked up manually and plugged into the system. For first testing, I will create a dummy corpus of lorem-ipsum style documents which will contain a random sampling of units.
