\section{Introduction}

\ednote{Write an introductary sentence / paragraph?}

MathWebSearch (MWS for short\ednote{should I really use abbreviations here?}) is a system to search (latex) documents for mathematical formulae. Additionally it can also search for text in the documents\ednote{Or is this the multi-faceted search that is currently planned? Do we really need this sentence?}. However it not only searches for formulae in a simple-minded string way but also includes simple transformation rules, such as $a + b = b + a$. Additionally, is is possible to search with wildcards such as $ { \color{red} x} + \sqrt{\color{red} x}$. In this example MWS delivers results of the given form where $\color{red} x$ is substituted with any sub-formular\ednote{Re-formulate this and link to an example}.

MWS has been shown to be very useful for mathematicians\ednote{Quote neeeded}. The transformation system it uses can currently be used only for mathematical formulae which limits its applications. In this paper we propose an extension for physical units\ednote{Reformulate this?}. Instead of transforming mathematical formulae, the search engine should transfer physical units.
The end-user will search, for example, \SI{100}{\degreeCelsius} and also get results which show $212$$^\circ$F or $373.15$K.

This proposal is organised as follows\ednote{Update this possible if we change the structure}: In section \ref{sec:mws} we describe the existing MathWebSearch system and then proceed in section \ref{sec:extension} to discuss the proposed extension. Finally in section \ref{sec:problems_relatedwork} we discuss possible problems with this approach and related work.
