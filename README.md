# Bachelor Thesis Repository

This is the source for the write-ups of my Bachelor Thesis (the actual code is in other places).

There are 3 parts to this:
* ```proposal/``` - The proposal for the topic
* ```thesis/``` - The actual thesis write-up
* ```presentation/``` - The beamer-latex used for my presentation

Assuming you have ``latexmk`` installed, you should be able to compile these by just running `make`.
