\section{Putting It Together: The Implementation And Its Limits}
\label{sec:pit}

We can now join all these components together to build a search engine. To recap, we need these components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MMT, so that we can use Terms and theories. Specifically, the mmt-api.
  \item Theories and Views in MMT notation, contained in mmt files.
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:frontend}
* Frontend: HTML / JS
* Harveste
\subsection{Caveats}
* type equalities
* requirements of the graph
* (in)stabilities of MMT
* davenport units (relative units)
